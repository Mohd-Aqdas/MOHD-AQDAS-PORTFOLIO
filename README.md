## CASE STUDY 1 :- "Cyclistic Case Study:Analysing the usage for Customer Growth"
Author: Mohd Aqdas

Date: 2022-09-23

Data Source:- Cyclistic

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

I will conduct my Analysis based on 6 steps:-
Ask

Prepare

Process

Analyze

Share

Act

## First Step- Ask

### Defining Business Task
There are two types of customers, casual riders and members. Lily Moreno (The director of marketing) came up with a hypothesis: Converting casual riders into members would lead to more profitable growth.

There are three questions which will lead us through the analysis and back the hypothesis:-

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### Key stakeholders
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy

Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.


### (This whole analysis is done with R in Rstudio)
## Second step- Prepare
In this step, we will download and store the data in an organized structure. Then we will sort the data for further analysis.

## Fourth Step- Analyze
In this step, we analyzed our data and draw some patterns and trends. We also created some appealing visuals in R and Tableau.

**After completing four steps, there are two steps left Share and Act.**

## Fifth Step Share-

In this step,we will create a presentation which contains all of our studies with some appealing visuals.

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

The data lacks information, which decreased the accuracy of results.

It was quite tough to specify the difference between members and casual riders.

But, surprisingly we made some general differences in the user pattern of both riders.

Both users use cyclistic differently:-

Casual Riders- Most of the users use Cyclistic more for leisure and some use Cyclistic to commute to work each day.

Members- Most of them use Cyclistic to commute to work each day and some users use Cyclistic for leisure.

## Final Step:-Act

In this step, we will present our findings along with our suggestions to the key stakeholders.

### RECOMMENDATION
**1- Recommendations:-**

*a.) Introduce time limit-* As we saw earlier in the analysis that casual users take a lot more time during one trip.  So, we can impose a time limit on casual rides. The time limit could be 24 hrs from the start time of a trip. And the Membership will have no such boundaries.

*b.) Introduce membership options–* Introducing flexible membership options will help to encourage casual riders to purchase a membership. Here we will use the decoy effect strategy in the pricing of membership options. We will divide the membership into three options- Quarterly, Halfyearly, and Annual membership.

*c.)Using digital and print media–* To impose our strategy of converting casual riders into members we have to start a marketing campaign to convert more casual riders possible into members.Create Cyclistic Fitness and environment-related campaign on social media to encourage people to leave automobiles and use cycles to be fit, save the environment, and also save money by not spending on fuel.

**2- Recommendations:-**

*a.) Collect more data*

*b.) Make the problem more clear*

*c.) Conduct a Survey*

## CONCLUSION

We know that casual riders and members use Cyclistic differently but we don’t know the reason why they do so.

We have got some results but they do not have enough information which makes them less accurate or maybe Inaccurate.

With the lack of information it is very risky to move forward with our strategy.

I’ll propose to go with the second recommendation, which is to wait and collect more meaningful data to get some meaningful insights.
